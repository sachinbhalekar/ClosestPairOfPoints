# ClosestPairOfPoints

Problem: Given  an  instance  of ClosestPairOfPoints determine  minimum  distance  between  any  2  points  with  a O(nlg(n)) time algorithm.</br>

Input: The input file will be called input2.txt and be in the same directory as the java and class files.  Each line will be two integer values sepearted by whitespace which represents the X and Y values of the points.</br>

Output: A single number which is thesquareof the distance between the closest pair of points (the reason I wantthe square is to avoid precision errors).</br></br>

Examples:If the input was</br>
14 3</br>
1 1</br>
5 10</br>
13 0</br>
then the output woud be</br>
10</br></br>

since the closest pair of points are (13,0) and (14,3) yielding 12+ 32.
